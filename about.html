						I started in tibia in <b>2007</b>, I believe it was version <b>7.9</b> at the time, in the world of <b>Amera</b>. Land of ancient legends like <b>Eternal Oblivion</b> and <b>Will Hunting</b>.</br>
						Since then I have had social experiences within the game that I believe should be lived by more people, both experiences that resulted in some success, and those that resulted in failure or some loss.</br>
						As my profession and career were built by the will and curiosity that Tibia and the bots gave me at the time. And I would like to create that same enthusiasm for the new generations to come.</br>
						The intention of this server is <b>NOT</b> to make you put your life aside as you did in adolescence, to live inside a retro game and earning profits for the owner.</br>
						<b>THERE ARE NO PAYMENT METHODS IMPLEMENTED AND THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE THROUGH PAYMENT.</b></br>
						The server is constantly being updated and is a <b>project that had the initial idea in 2019</b> and was shelved for a while, but is now getting off the ground.</br>
						I hope you understand that I don't have support from other people and I do all the systems and fixes myself. So be patient.</br>
						I also emphasize that if you are interested in chatting, criticizing, talking about the server or anything else, you can find me by email writing in English or Portuguese: tibiacconta1@gmail.com
